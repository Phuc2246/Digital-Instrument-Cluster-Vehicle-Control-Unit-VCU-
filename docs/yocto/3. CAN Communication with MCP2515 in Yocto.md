# CAN Communication with MCP2515 in Yocto

> **This document is written based on the actual project configuration** (`bblayers.conf`, `local.conf`) and uses **MCP2515 over SPI**.

Target platform: **Raspberry Pi 4**
Init system: **systemd**
CAN stack: **SocketCAN**

---

## 1. Overview

The Raspberry Pi 4 does not include a native CAN controller. In this project, CAN bus communication is enabled using the **MCP2515 standalone CAN controller**, connected to the Raspberry Pi via the **SPI interface**, together with an external CAN transceiver.

The Linux kernel exposes MCP2515 through **SocketCAN**, allowing CAN interfaces to be used like standard network devices (e.g. `can0`). This makes the CAN layer independent of the underlying hardware and suitable for **VCU / automotive-style applications**.

---

## 2. Yocto Layer Setup (Current Project)

Based on `bblayers.conf`, the following layers are already included:

* `meta-raspberrypi`
* `meta-openembedded` (oe, multimedia, networking, python)
* `meta-qt5`
* `meta-phuc` (custom project layer)

These layers are sufficient to support:

* SPI
* MCP2515 CAN driver
* SocketCAN
* `can-utils`

No additional third-party CAN layers are required.

---

## 3. Machine and Init Configuration

From `local.conf`:

```conf
MACHINE = "raspberrypi4"
INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"
```

Systemd is required for:

* Consistent network management
* Service auto-start
* Embedded VCU-style system design

---

## 4. Enabling SPI and MCP2515 (Device Tree)

SPI and MCP2515 are enabled directly via Raspberry Pi device tree overlays in `local.conf`:

```conf
RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG:append = "\n\
 dtparam=spi=on\n\
 dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=8000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=1000000\n\
"
```

### Explanation:

* `dtparam=spi=on` → Enables SPI bus
* `mcp2515-can0` → MCP2515 driver bound as `can0`
* `oscillator=8000000` → MCP2515 crystal frequency (8 MHz)
* `interrupt=25` → GPIO 25 used for MCP2515 INT
* `spimaxfrequency=1000000` → SPI clock (1 MHz for stability)

⚠️ **Important:** The oscillator value **must match the crystal on your MCP2515 module**.

---

## 5. Kernel and User-Space Packages

The image explicitly includes CAN-related tools and modules:

```conf
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " kernel-modules can-utils iproute2 "
```

This provides:

* MCP2515 kernel driver (`can-mcp251x`)
* SocketCAN core support
* User-space testing tools (`candump`, `cansend`)

---

## 6. CAN Interface Bring-Up

After booting the Yocto image on Raspberry Pi 4, the MCP2515 interface appears as `can0`.

### 6.1 Enable CAN Interface

```bash
ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
```

### 6.2 Verify Interface Status

```bash
ip -details -statistics link show can0
```

Expected output should show:

* `state UP`
* Correct bitrate
* RX/TX counters increasing when traffic is present

---

## 7. Testing CAN with can-utils

### 7.1 Receive CAN Frames

```bash
candump can0
```

### 7.2 Send CAN Frames

```bash
cansend can0 123#1122
cansend can0 1ABCDEEF#010203
```

Where:

* `123` → Standard 11-bit CAN ID
* `1ABCDEEF` → Extended 29-bit CAN ID

---

## 8. SocketCAN Programming Model (VCU-Oriented)

SocketCAN provides a **POSIX socket API**, making CAN communication hardware-independent.

### 8.1 Required Headers

```c
#include <linux/can.h>
#include <linux/can/raw.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <net/if.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
```

---

### 8.2 Socket Initialization

```c
int s = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_RAW);

struct ifreq ifr;
strcpy(ifr.ifr_name, "can0");
ioctl(s, SIOCGIFINDEX, &ifr);

struct sockaddr_can addr = {
    .can_family = AF_CAN,
    .can_ifindex = ifr.ifr_ifindex
};

bind(s, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
```

---

### 8.3 Sending a CAN Frame

```c
struct can_frame frame;
frame.can_id  = 0x123;
frame.can_dlc = 8;
memcpy(frame.data, "\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88", 8);

write(s, &frame, sizeof(frame));
```

---

### 8.4 Receiving a CAN Frame

```c
read(s, &frame, sizeof(frame));
printf("ID: 0x%X DLC: %d\n", frame.can_id, frame.can_dlc);
```

---

## 9. Notes and Best Practices

* MCP2515 is SPI-based → **SPI timing and interrupt wiring are critical**
* Always use **120 Ω termination** at both ends of the CAN bus
* For VCU applications, use:

  * CAN filters
  * `select()` / `poll()` for non-blocking I/O
* SocketCAN code remains unchanged if migrating to native CAN hardware in the future

---

## 10. Summary

* CAN is implemented using **MCP2515 over SPI**
* Configuration matches the **actual Yocto project setup**
* No USB-to-CAN devices are used
* Fully compatible with **VCU / automotive embedded systems**
